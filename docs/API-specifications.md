# Altus — Backend API Specifications

This document defines all HTTP endpoints exposed by the Altus backend, structured around the user journey.

**Base URL (local):** `http://localhost:5600/v1`
**Base URL (production):** `https://api.altus.games/v1`

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript |
| Backend | Node.js + Express.js |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | JWT / Google OAuth 2.0 |
| Pose Detection | MediaPipe (frontend only) |
| Camera Access | getUserMedia (frontend only) |

---

## Naming Convention

All field names in requests and responses use **snake_case** — the same casing the database uses. The database is the source of truth; no transformation is applied between the DB row and the JSON response.

---

## User Journey

```
Visitor arrives
  └─ Can view leaderboard (public)
  └─ Clicks "Play" → redirected to register or login

Register or Login
  └─ Email + password  →  POST /auth/register  or  POST /auth/login
  └─ Google Sign-In   →  POST /auth/google
  └─ Both return a JWT

Authenticated user
  └─ GET /exercises → choose exercise (difficulties nested inside)
  └─ Plays game (MediaPipe tracks reps on frontend)
  └─ POST /workout_sessions → save score
  └─ Achievements checked automatically after save

Profile page
  └─ GET /users/me → own profile
  └─ GET /workout_sessions/me → exercise history
  └─ GET /users/me/achievements → unlocked achievements
  └─ GET /users/me/stats → summary statistics

Leaderboard (public)
  └─ GET /leaderboard → top 50 global
  └─ GET /leaderboard/:exercise_name → top 50 per exercise
  └─ GET /leaderboard/me/rank → own rank (auth required)
```

---

## Authentication

After registering or logging in, the server returns a signed JWT. The frontend stores it and sends it with every protected request.

### Protected Request Header

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---

## Standard Error Response

All errors return JSON in this shape:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message"
}
```

The HTTP status code is the machine-readable signal — `409` means conflict, `401` means unauthenticated, `400` means bad input. The `error` string is human-readable context for debugging. A separate `code` field is only needed when multiple different errors share the same HTTP status and the frontend must distinguish between them — Altus does not have that requirement.

| HTTP Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Bad request — missing or invalid fields |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid JWT |
| `403` | Forbidden — authenticated but not permitted |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `409` | Conflict — e.g. email already registered |
| `500` | Internal server error |

---

## Authentication API

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | No | Create account (email + password) |
| POST | `/auth/login` | No | Login (email + password) |
| POST | `/auth/google` | No | Login or register via Google OAuth *(Phase 7b — deferred)* |

---

### POST `/auth/register`

Creates a new account. Returns a JWT immediately — no separate login step needed.

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| username | string | Yes | Unique, max 50 characters |
| email | string | Yes | Valid email, unique |
| password | string | Yes | Minimum 8 characters |

**Request Example**
```json
{
  "username": "player1",
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response — `201 Created`**
```json
{
  "token": "<jwt_token>",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "username": "player1",
    "email": "player@example.com",
    "google_id": null,
    "role": "user",
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `400` invalid or missing fields — `409` email already registered — `409` username already taken

---

### POST `/auth/login`

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| email | string | Yes |
| password | string | Yes |

**Request Example**
```json
{
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
{
  "token": "<jwt_token>",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "username": "player1",
    "email": "player@example.com",
    "google_id": null,
    "role": "user",
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `400` missing fields — `401` invalid credentials — `401` account uses Google Sign-In (wrong auth method)

---

### POST `/auth/google`

The frontend obtains a Google ID token using the Google Sign-In button. It sends that token here — the backend verifies it with Google's API and either creates a new account or logs in the existing one.

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| id_token | string | Yes |

**Request Example**
```json
{
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5..."
}
```

**Response — `200 OK` (existing user) or `201 Created` (new user)**
```json
{
  "token": "<jwt_token>",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "username": "player1",
    "email": "player@example.com",
    "google_id": "google-oauth2|123456789",
    "role": "user",
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors:** `400` missing id_token — `401` invalid Google token (verification with Google API failed) — `409` email already registered with email/password — `500` internal server error

---

## Exercises API

Called once after login. The frontend stores the result in React context — each game component is linked to its exercise by name. The difficulty presets include `target_reps` (so the game knows when to stop) and `exercise_difficulty_id` (sent to the backend when saving a completed session).

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/exercises` | Yes 🔒 | Fetch all active exercises with nested difficulty presets |

---

### GET `/exercises`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. Returns all exercises where `is_active = true`, with difficulty presets nested inside each exercise.

**Architecture note:** The game runs entirely on the frontend — MediaPipe tracks reps, the score increments locally in real time. The backend is only called once at the end of a session (`POST /workout_sessions`). This endpoint is fetched once on login and cached in React context — no repeat calls during gameplay.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Squats",
    "description": "Standard squat exercise",
    "calories_per_rep": 0.32,
    "difficulties": [
      { "id": "uuid", "level_name": "Easy",   "target_reps": 5,  "score_multiplier": 1.0 },
      { "id": "uuid", "level_name": "Medium", "target_reps": 10, "score_multiplier": 1.5 },
      { "id": "uuid", "level_name": "Hard",   "target_reps": 20, "score_multiplier": 2.0 }
    ]
  }
]
```

---

## Workout Sessions API

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/workout_sessions` | Yes 🔒 | Save a completed workout session |
| GET | `/workout_sessions/me` | Yes 🔒 | Retrieve the authenticated user's session history |

---

### POST `/workout_sessions`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. The `user_id` is taken from the JWT — never send it in the request body.

**How scoring works:**
The game runs locally — the frontend displays a live score during play using its own calculation. When the session ends, the frontend sends only the raw data (`reps_completed`, `duration_seconds`, `exercise_difficulty_id`). The backend independently calculates the authoritative score and calories from the DB — the frontend's in-game score is never sent or trusted.

- `score = reps_completed × score_multiplier` (looked up from `exercise_difficulties`)
- `calories_burned = reps_completed × calories_per_rep` (looked up from `exercises`)

This prevents score manipulation — a tampered request body cannot change the stored score because the backend never reads a client-sent score.

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| exercise_difficulty_id | UUID | Yes | ID of the selected difficulty preset |
| reps_completed | integer | Yes | Number of valid repetitions completed |
| duration_seconds | integer | Yes | Session duration in seconds |

**Request Example**
```json
{
  "exercise_difficulty_id": "3f7a1b2c-...",
  "reps_completed": 15,
  "duration_seconds": 60
}
```

**Response — `201 Created`**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "score": 630,
  "calories_burned": 13.44,
  "completed_at": "2025-06-01T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` missing or invalid fields — `404` exercise difficulty not found

> After saving, the backend checks whether the user has unlocked any new achievements. This happens automatically — no separate API call is needed from the frontend.

---

### GET `/workout_sessions/me`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. Returns the authenticated user's full workout history.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "exercise": "Squats",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "reps_completed": 15,
    "score": 630,
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "calories_burned": 13.44,
    "completed_at": "2025-06-01T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Users API

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/users/me` | Yes 🔒 | Fetch the authenticated user's full profile |
| PUT | `/users/me` | Yes 🔒 | Update the authenticated user's profile |
| GET | `/users/me/stats` | Yes 🔒 | Fetch the authenticated user's workout statistics |
| GET | `/users/me/achievements` | Yes 🔒 | Fetch the authenticated user's unlocked achievements |
| GET | `/users/:id` | No | Fetch a user's public profile *(deferred — not needed for core gameplay)* |

> **Route order note:** `/users/me` must be registered before `/users/:id` in the routes file. Express matches routes top-to-bottom — if `/:id` is first, the word `me` is treated as an id parameter and the `/me` route never runs.

---

### GET `/users/me`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. Returns the full profile for the logged-in user.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "player1",
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "google_id": null,
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### PUT `/users/me`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. All fields are optional — only send what is changing.

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| username | string | Max 50 characters, unique |

**Response — `200 OK`** — returns the full updated user profile
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "username": "newname",
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "google_id": null,
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` invalid fields — `409` username already taken

---

### GET `/users/me/stats`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. Returns the authenticated user's workout statistics, calculated live from the `workout_sessions` table.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
{
  "total_sessions": 42,
  "total_reps": 1250,
  "total_calories_burned": 380.50,
  "best_score": 980,
  "most_played_exercise": "Squats"
}
```

---

### GET `/users/me/achievements`

🔒 Requires valid JWT. Returns all achievements unlocked by the authenticated user.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "First Rep",
    "description": "Complete your first workout session",
    "badge_image": "https://...",
    "unlocked_at": "2025-06-01T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

---

## Leaderboard API

The leaderboard is public — no login required to view it.

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/leaderboard` | No | Top 50 scores across all exercises |
| GET | `/leaderboard/me/rank` | Yes 🔒 | Authenticated user's global ranking |
| GET | `/leaderboard/:exercise_name` | No | Top 50 scores for a specific exercise *(deferred — no frontend UI yet)* |

> **Route order note:** `/leaderboard/me/rank` must be registered before `/leaderboard/:exercise_name`. Same reason as users — specific paths before parameterised paths.

---

### GET `/leaderboard`

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
[
  {
    "rank": 1,
    "username": "player1",
    "score": 1250,
    "exercise": "Squats",
    "completed_at": "2025-06-01T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "rank": 2,
    "username": "player2",
    "score": 1180,
    "exercise": "Pushups",
    "completed_at": "2025-06-01T09:15:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

---

### GET `/leaderboard/me/rank`

🔒 Requires valid JWT.

**Response — `200 OK`**
```json
{
  "rank": 14,
  "total_players": 203,
  "best_score": 630
}
```

---

### GET `/leaderboard/:exercise_name` *(deferred)*

> No frontend UI exists for per-exercise leaderboard filtering yet. This endpoint will be built when the frontend needs it.

Filters top 50 by exercise name (e.g. `/leaderboard/Squats`).

**Response — `200 OK`** — same shape as `/leaderboard`, filtered to one exercise.

**Errors:** `404` exercise name not recognised
